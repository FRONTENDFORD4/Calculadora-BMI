          <h1>What your BMI result means</h1>

          <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
            healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
            such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
            fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
            strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
            five days a week.</p>

        <h1> Limitations of BMI</h1>
        <p>
          Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
          every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
          certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.</p>

        <p>
          The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
          a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.</p>
